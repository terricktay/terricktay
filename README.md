- 👋 Hi, I’m @terricktay
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, SQL, python and pytorch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to working on a machine learning project that correlate the chemical analysis results on lubricant oil quality and the vibration wave.
By monitoring the vibration wave, it can predict the preventive maintaince required for the machinery.
